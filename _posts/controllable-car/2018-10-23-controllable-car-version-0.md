Initial version of me experimenting with a controllable car in Unity.

Main Feature Summary:
- Look and move around to detect planes using ARCore.
- Tap a plane to spawn a car.
- Use the menu to change the scene state into one of two states:
    - Edit: To be able to spawn cars.
    - Nonedit: Car does not spawn when tapping a plane.
- Jump button currently disabled.
- No vehicle options at the moment.
- Left joystick controls forward and backward movement while right joystick is to turn.

Here is a short demo gif:
